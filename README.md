# CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis - House Price Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach analyzing data sets to summarize their main
characteristics such as mean, standard deviation, and count, so on, often with visual
methods. It’s where the researcher takes a bird’s eye view of the data and tries to make
some sense of it. It’s often the first step in data analysis, implemented before any formal
statistical techniques are applied

# CA02: Spam eMail Detection using Naive Bayes
Classification Algorithm
In this exercise we shall train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam
or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category.
Next, we shall test the model on 260 emails. We shall ask model to predict the category
of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know

# CA03: Decision Tree Algorithm
In this assignment, we imported Census data related to income levels, conducted exploratory 
data analysis (EDA), cleaned the data, encoded categorical variables, and constructed
a Decision Tree model based on our dataset. Subsequently, we experimented with different 
hyperparameters to optimize our tree's performance. 
Finally, we evaluated the model's effectiveness by making predictions on unseen data.
