# CA02: Spam eMail Detection using Naive Bayes
Classification Algorithm
In this exercise we shall train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam
or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category.
Next, we shall test the model on 260 emails. We shall ask model to predict the category
of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know
