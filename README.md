# CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis - House Price Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach used to analyze datasets with the aim of summarizing their key characteristics. These characteristics include measures such as mean, standard deviation, count, and others. EDA typically involves the use of visual methods to gain insights into the data's patterns and distributions. It serves as the initial step in data analysis, usually conducted before the application of more formal statistical techniques.
